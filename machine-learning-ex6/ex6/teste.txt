Dear Students,
 
We look forward to the second year of the Newman Institute for Catholic Thought and Culture, and to offering two three-credit courses. Please find the course descriptions attached.  Visit the Newman Institute's website to download the application and register: www.newmaninstitute.com
 
The first course, Introduction to the Great Books I: Seekers, Sojourners and Pilgrims, was well received last semester so we decided to offer it again. That course has received an ACE 8 designation by UNL. It has also been approved as an elective through Classics. The second course, Humanities Seminar I: Love and Friendship, will be offered for the first time.
 
Please lest me know if you have any questions.
 
Blessed Passiontide!
 
Dr. John Freeh
